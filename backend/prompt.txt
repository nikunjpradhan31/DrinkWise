You are an experienced and seasoned backend engineer. You task is to create a backend service for my application DrinkWise
(User account registration and authentication
Browsing, rating, and liking functionality for drinks
A hybrid recommendation engine combining:
Content-Based Filtering: Matches drink attributes with user preferences
Collaborative Filtering: Leverages patterns from similar users’ behavior
The result is a tailored list of recommended drinks displayed in a user-friendly dashboard.)

Frontend	React.js
Backend	    FastAPI
Database	PostgreSQL

Look at the endpoints and create a FastAPI backend service for the application found in the INPUTSOUTPUTS.md and look at the
model schema in the backend_drinks/models.py file and ensure that the endpoints are implemented correctly along with the (backend_drinks/database.py) database connections I have created in the database.py file.

Please divide my endpoints and use service based and OOP based architecture to create the backend service in backend_drinks folder

Take some inspiration from the backend_himal backend service (A previous project of mine)
Use similar and straightforward logic for the email (2FA) verification found in the backend_himal backend service

Also, in terms of the recommendation engine, I would like to use a hybrid model that combines content-based and collaborative filtering.
Where there will be drink to drinks, user (multiple drinks ) to drinks and user to user similarity (drinks) recommendation, please set up the boiler plate
code and functions for the actual recommendation engine as I will implement the actual recommendation engine later. Please ensure the those functions are
in the correct service and are called in the correct endpoint and are connected to the endpoints in the INPUTSOUTPUTS.md file.

Please ask any questions you have before starting the project and any clarifications you need as you go.
