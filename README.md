# ðŸ¥¤ DrinkWise: A Personalized Drinks Recommendation System

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Choosing the right drinkâ€”whether coffee, tea, cocktails, or smoothiesâ€”can be overwhelming due to the vast range of flavors and ingredients. Many rely on limited or generic recommendations that may not match their personal tastes.  
**DrinkWise** solves this problem by delivering personalized drink recommendations through a **hybrid machine learning approach**, combining both content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
